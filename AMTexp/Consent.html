<p> <b>About the Study:</b> This study will investigate how you process information and make decisions. 
Expect to spend an hour at most to complete this study. If you choose to take part in this study, you will be asked to participate in different types of tasks. 
We may ask you to make decisions based on sounds (such as spoken words in English or non-speech sounds) or images or videos 
(such as faces, everyday objects, patterns, shapes, animals) that we will present to you. You may also be asked to fill out some questionnaires about your demographic information, attitudes 
and preferences regarding different types of decisions.
</p>

If you do not complete the task, or we feel that you completed it to an unsatisfactory standard (ie. you do not follow the instructions), you will not be compensated. 
This policy is in line with Amazon Mechanical Turk standards, which state "a Requester may reject your work if the HIT was not completed correctly or the instructions were not followed."</p>
